# kitt-peak

This is some scripts/software Iâ€™m developing based on all-sky images from the kitt-peak observatory. It should probably have version control so I set this up.

At present:

#Difference.py
- Finds the difference between two images.

#Median.py
- Downloads all the images from a given day
